### Installation Instructions

Download the repository into a folder. 

Open Matlab and make sure your current folder is the folder that contains the task script

At the prompt, type `Setup` to start the setup procedure. Make sure that you've edited the instructions file (see below) before running `Setup` otherwise you'll need to run it again after the new text has been entered. 

After the Setup is complete run `MainTask` to run the experiment. You should only need to run `Setup` once per machine. 

### Configuration

To input the instructions of the main task, please edit the file called `Instructions.txt`. Write the instructions on one line. You'll be able to adjust the line breaking and font size when you run `Setup`
